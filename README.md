Answers:
Software Engineering

Software engineering is an engineering approach to software development. A practitioner, a software engineer, applies the engineering design process to develop software.
The term programmer and coder overlap software engineering, but they imply only the construction aspect of typical software engineer workload.
A software engineer applies a software development process, which involves the definition, implementation, testing, management and maintenance of software systems and with development of the software systems and with development of the software development process itself.

Software Development Lifecycle

The software development life cycle is a process that development teams use to create awesome software that's top-notch in terms of quality, cost-effectiveness, and time efficiency. The main goal is to minimize risks long before deciding how to launch your SaaS product and ensure the software meets the customer's expectations during and after production.

Agile versus Waterfall model

Waterfall and Agile are two different project management methodologies for software development. Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach that requires deliverables for each phase and is suitable for projects with strict regulations and fixed. Agile is an incremental and iterative approach that allows for flexibility and experimentation and is suitable for projects with evolving scope and changing conditions.

Requirement Engineering

A systematic and strict approach to the definition, creation, and verification of requirements for a software system is known as requirements engineering
Requirements engineering is a critical step in the software development lifecycle, it involves understanding customer desires, analyzing feasibility, specifying solutions, and managing requirements as they are transformed into a working system. Requirements serve as a bridge between technical and conceptual realms, providing actionable blueprints for building solutions.

Software Design Principles

Modularity in software design refers to breaking down a system into smaller, self-contained components called modules. These modules encapsulate specific functionality, operate independently, and can be developed, maintained, and reused without affecting the rest of the system.
Benefits of modularity include:
- Organized and reusable code
- Parallel development and collaboration
- Efficient maintenance.

Testing in Software Engineering

Different levels of software testing include:

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components to verify their combined functionality.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system to ensure it meets requirements and functions as expected.
Acceptance Testing: Testing by end-users to validate that the software meets their needs.
Testing is crucial in software development because;
It helps identify and fix defects early in the development process.

Version Control Systems

Version control system (VCS), also known as source control, is a software tool that automates the management of changes to software code. It helps development teams track modifications to source code over time
Version control systems (VCS) are essential in software development because they:
Track changes in code over time, allowing developers to collaborate, manage code, and maintain a history of changes
Ensure code integrity, collaboration, and efficient development workflows.
Examples of popular version control systems and their features:
Git: Distributed, supports branching, merging, and collaboration.
Subversion (SVN): Centralized, tracks changes, and supports branching.
Mercurial: Distributed, lightweight, and easy to use.

Software Project Management

Software project managers are in charge of the planning, scheduling, budgeting, execution, and delivery of software and web projects. They ensure the successful completion of all software projects and also oversee the people performing work on the projects.
The role of a software project manager includes the following key responsibilities and challenges:
-	Overseeing project success and quality from inception to completion
-	Managing scope, stakeholder communication, risk, and quality assurance
-	Bridging technical teams and stakeholders
-	Handling information flow, adapting to changes, and meeting client expectations
-	Aligning project objectives with business goals.

Software Maintenance

Software maintenance is an integral part of the software life cycle that involves modifying and updating software after it has been deployed.
The different types of maintenance activities include:
Corrective maintenance: Fixing defects or errors.
Adaptive maintenance: Modifying software to adapt to changes in the environment.
Perfective maintenance: Enhancing software to improve performance or add new features.
Preventive maintenance: Proactively addressing potential issues before they become problems. Maintenance is essential because it ensures software remains reliable, secure, and up-to-date throughout its lifetime.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering

Although software developers work primarily behind the scenes in businesses, their decisions in the course of a project can have an outsized impact in the world for better or worse. Everyone in the industry should be aware of social and ethical issues in software development.
Here are some examples of ethical issues software engineers might face;
-	Addictive design
-	Corporate ownership of personal data
-	Algorithmic bias
-	Weak cyber security and personally identifiable information (PII) protection
-	Overemphasis on features.
